## My process

### Built with

- HTML and CSS

### What I learned

A new style element introduced with this project was the animated change of the link button styles on hover, unlike the previous project where the style change was instantaneous. In this case, I was able to use the CSS `transition` property instead of using animations.

### Continued development

Continue practicing basic HTML/CSS/Javascript before starting on React and other Javascript and CSS libraries and frameworks.
